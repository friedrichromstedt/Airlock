[a01]:
    Drafted the periodicity to 10 phases, each 2 pixels wide.  I paid
    attention that the vertical pipe is coloured correctly.

    I used the bugfixed graphic [2021-11-24_1843/g02.psp].

    Used green colour at brightness 0, 25, 50, ..., 200, 225 (10 points).

    Mapping this ten points onto [0, 360) degrees will make it possible to
    colour the pipe with a smooth scale of red (brightness 190 +- 50) when
    using cos^2 or sin^2 of the corresponding angles 0, 36, 72, ..., 288,
    324 (10 points, separated by 36 degrees).

    The colours can be applied in the whole Graphics in one run by using
    the colour replacer (that's why I coloured the phases green).

    Maybe the pipe in the ceiling needs to be made more thick, 3 or 4
    pixels instead of the momentary 2 pixels.

[b01]:
    Adding two more pixels to the bend region at the top-centre.

[b02-b07]:
    Ticks 0-4 of the Pump-Left animation.

[c01-c04]:
    Ticks 5-9 of the Pump-Left animation.

[c05]:
    Recreating, starting from [2021-11-24_1843/g01] (Bugfixed).
